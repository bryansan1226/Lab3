# Lab3
 This program uses the CSV file for the top Spotify singles 
 and produces a file with an alphabetically sorted list of all the artists 
 that appeared, ignoring duplicates. It does this by running the list through 
 a bubble sort that compares the first letter of all the names.
 The source code is located in the .src folder.
